Standing on the coast, you look out across the boundless sea. Having tamed the wilds of your homeland, your heart
yearns for greater adventures, greater conquests. Your people are ready to follow you, even into the unexpected dangers of
the unknown. Nearby, seasoned dock workers are putting the finishing touches on your first great seaworthy ship. Soon
you will leave the settlements behind to join the ranks of explorers and conquerors. Soon you will become one of the

playing with the Seafarers expansion!
2. Ship Building
In order to travel from one island to another, you need to
build ships. You cannot satisfy your hunger to expand with
roads alone!
The ship pieces in the game do not represent the individual
ships, just as roads do not represent the actual carts
and wagons that travel along your trade routes.
Instead, the ship pieces represent a “shipping
route.” This is the route that ships use to trade and
travel between the islands.
To build a ship, expend 1 wool resource (to make sails) and 1
lumber resource (to build hulls and masts).
Like roads, ships can only be placed on the boundary (hex
side) between two hexes. Unlike roads, ships cannot be placed
between two land hexes. You may only build ships between two Illustration B
sea hexes (forming an aquatic route) or between a sea hex and
a land hex (a coastal route). You may not build a ship along a

Roads and ships may not be built along the same coastline.
The biggest difference between ships and roads is the ability

pieces, ships may be moved. However, there are limits to how
ships may be moved. You must obey these restrictions when
you move your ships:
• You may only move 1 ship per turn, and only during your
building phase.
• You may not move a ship on the same turn you originally
built it.
• When you move a ship, you must obey all of the usual
Y ES
rules for placing a new ship.
• You may only move a ship where one of its two ends is not
adjacent to any of your other pieces. In Illustration D the
ships outlined in white can move. So, none of the orange
ships can move. Three of the red ships, and only one of the
blue ships can move.
Illustration C
3. The Purpose of Ships
Shipping routes act as roads across water (or along the coast).
You build and place ships in much the same way as roads. They
connect two adjacent intersections. A chain of connected ships
of the same color form a “shipping route.” Shipping routes act
the same way as roads for expanding your principality. You can
build new pieces anywhere that is connected to your network
of roads and shipping routes. Count shipping routes when you
calculate the “Longest Trade Route” (see page 5).
If your shipping route reaches a coastline, you can then
build a new settlement on that coast, even if it is a new island.
Of course, you must still obey the “distance rule” from basic
Catan, even if you are building on a new island. Once you
build a settlement on a new island, you can use it as a base

longest trade route is in all ways identical to the longest road
(i.e., it is worth 2 victory points, etc.), but players may count
shipping routes (open or closed) as well as roads to determine
who controls the longest trade route. The player with the
longest continuous line of roads and/or ships receives the
Longest Trade Route special card and the 2 victory points for it.
Remember that you can only connect a road to a shipping
route if there is a settlement or a city at the intersection where
the two meet. Also, you can only count the single longest
branch of a road and/or shipping route to calculate the longest
trade route.
Example: (See illustration F.) You have the longest trade route. The
route includes 4 ships (a closed shipping route) and 2 roads, which
are linked by settlement “A”. You also constructed a shipping route
starting from settlement “B”. You can connect these 2 ships (an open
shipping route) to your road if you build a settlement at intersection
“C”. This will increase the length of your trade route to 8.
6. Catan Chits and Special Victory Points
Catan chits fulfill different tasks in the individual
scenarios. They can be applied as special victory
points, serve as markers, or help to count
the results.
Many of the scenarios have goals other than
expanding your principality. These goals can award a successful
player special victory points. When you earn a special victory
point, you receive a catan chit. Each scenario describes the rules
for how to acquire these chits.
When you earn a special victory point, you must place the
corresponding catan chit underneath a settlement or city on the
board. You must use the settlement or city that earned you the
chit. This allows all the other players to see how many points 8. The “Road Building”

A general note on Catan rules. This is the 5th English-
language edition of Catan: Seafarers. Over the years, the rules
have been clarified, refined, and occasionally updated. As of
December 1, 2020, all of the rules in this version of Catan take

Set-up Phase
You build your first two settlements with roads/ships on
the main island, as described in basic Catan. However, no
settlements may be placed on the small islands, nor on the
intersections marked with colored squares (brown and purple),
nor on the intersections with red exclamation points.
Remember: If you build a settlement on the coast, you may place
a ship (instead of a road) next to the settlement. You can then go
immediately out to sea.
• Each player receives 1 Catan chit.
• Place the wonder cards next to the game board.

Special Victory Points
If you build a settlement on one of the smaller islands, then
you receive a special victory point! Take a Catan chit and place
it under the settlement when you build it. It does not matter if
other players have already built settlements on that island.
Building the Wonders of Catan
Whoever is the first to start building a wonder can freely
choose between the 5 available. The other players must make
do with the wonders that are left. You may only build
1 wonder.
• You can start building a Wonder of Catan only if
you already met its requirements as specified on the
corresponding wonder Card. For example, you can start
building the Monument only if you have a city at a harbor
and have built a trade route with at least 5 consecutive,
unbranched roads or ships.
• If you meet the requirements for a wonder, you can start
building the wonder on your turn by placing one of your
ships on the corresponding wonder card (preferably below
the resource costs). But then you have to actually build this
wonder. Once you start building your wonder, no other
player may start building the same wonder.
• Each wonder is subdivided into four levels. Each level
costs the 5 resources indicated on the corresponding
wonder card.
• Once you have handed over the resources for the first level
of your Wonder of Catan, you place a Catan chit on the
“1” field of the wonder card. When you have finished the
second level, you move the chit to field “2,” and so on.
• If you have enough resources, you can build several levels
for your Wonder of Catan during the same turn.
Pirate & Robber
The robber starts on one of the 3 deserts. The pirate is not
used in this scenario.
Ending the Game
You win if...
• You finish building your Wonder of Catan (4th level)
OR
• If you have 10 victory points and have completed a higher
level of your wonder than any other player.
4. Variable Set-up
Within the given frame, the terrain hexes and number tokens
of the main island can be rearranged and combined freely.
However, the two terrain hexes adjacent to the deserts shouldn’t
receive favorable numbers (neither 6 nor 8).
