2 overview cards
1 lake hex
(prod. #s: 4, 10)
Preparation
Replace the desert hexes with the two lake hexes. You cannot place the lake on the edge of
the island (i.e., the coast). Mix all of the fish tokens from Traders & Barbarians and Traders &
Barbarians 5-6 together face down and place them near the resource cards. On each frame section,
place a fishing ground tile on each coastal space that does not have a harbor.
Additional Rules
Player 2 may use fish tokens during their build phase.

Preparation
Assemble the game board as shown in the illustration
on the right; other than that, the rules of the Traders &
Barbarians player scenario apply.
1 oasis hex 11 camels
Additional Rules
During player 1’s turn,
the rules for placing camels
and holding a voting round
work as in Traders &
Barbarians.
Once player 1’s turn is
over, player 2 may now
take their turn. The rules for
placing camels and holding
a voting round work as in
Traders & Barbarians with
player 2 considered to be
the player just finishing their
turn.
There are two oases
available now as caravan
starting points, for a total of
6 caravans. When you place
a new camel, you are free to
decide from which oasis to
start your caravan and which
caravan you want to extend
with the new camel.

tokens
Preparation
• Assemble the frame as shown in the illustration on page 8, using the two new frame pieces and
the frame pieces from CATAN and CATAN 5-6.
• Place the 3 quarry hexes, 3 glassworks hexes, 2 desert hexes, and the new castle hex as shown
in the illustration. The new quarries and glassworks have a slightly different design than the
corresponding hexes in Traders & Barbarians. The new hexes also allow you to build roads
and settlements on the coast, which is necessary to reach certain harbors. Make sure to place
these hexes next to frame pieces showing harbors. You should be able to reach all harbors, as
shown in the illustration on page 8.
• Fill the free spaces of the island with terrain hexes, in random order. You need all terrain hexes
from CATAN as well as from CATAN 5-6.
• Place the number tokens exactly as shown in the illustration on page 8. You need all of the
number tokens from CATAN 5-6.
Note: Because of the large number of hexes that require no number token, the number
tokens cannot be distributed in alphabetical order as usual.
77
• Place the commodity tokens produced by the castle beside the game board. Arrange the
commodity tokens of the marble quarry into 3 stacks of approximately the same size and place
one stack next to each quarry. Proceed accordingly for the commodity tokens of the glassworks.
Should the card stack next to one of the quarries or glassworks become depleted during the
game, you may also draw from either of the other two stacks—the individual stacks are not
assigned to a particular trade hex. The arrows in the illustration below indicate the suggested
locations for the stacks of commodity tokens.
• There are still only 3 barbarians in a game with 5 or 6 players. Place them on the paths
marked with a black “X” in the illustration below.

Additional Rules
Building roads and settlements/cities
You may build roads on all paths, according to
the usual rules. The quarry and the glassworks from
Traders & Barbarians have 10 paths you can build
roads on, and the corresponding hexes from Traders
& Barbarians have 12 such paths. All possible road
building paths are marked in gray in the illustration
on the right.
As always, you may not build a settlement on the
central plaza intersection of a trade hex. You may build
settlements/cities on the 4 intersections of the trade
hexes from Traders & Barbarians that border on
neighboring hexes, provided you observe the distance
rule. The same applies for the corresponding 6 intersec-
tions of the trade hexes from Traders & Barbarians 5-6. All potential settlement sites are marked
in gray in the illustration on the right.
A “2” or a “12” is rolled
When your production roll is a “2” or a “12,” do not re-roll the dice—there are hexes showing
these numbers.
Gold coins
Player 2 may not use gold to purchase resources during their build phase.
Moving your wagon
Player 2 may move the wagon (or use it in any way) and may upgrade the wagon.
