I answered in the negative at that time, because I thought that all wishes to experience more in Catan\nhad been fulfilled. With Catan–Seafarers , the game was extended spatially, and Cities & Knights provided it with\n®\ngreater depth.\nAt the beginning of 2006, we started a survey in the Catan Online World where, among other things, we asked the\ncitizens of this virtual game world which games they would want the most. “Variants of the base game” appeared at the\nvery top of the wish list."}

And now you’re holding the outcome in your hands!\nA campaign with 5 scenarios opens up entirely new challenges and possibilities to experience the base game in a new\nfashion, and well-established variants offer alternatives to adapt the game to one’s own needs.\nHence, this expansion is all about “variants of the basic bame,” and the complexity of the last two scenarios of the\ncampaign almost comes up to the standard of Cities & Knights."}
