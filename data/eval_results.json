Instead, every player who has more than 7 resource cards must select half (rounded down) of their resource cards and return them to the bank.

    "expected": "During setup, players place two settlements and two roads in snake order, with each settlement on a vertex and each road extending from it.",
    "predicted": "In the initial placement phase of the game, each player takes turns placing one settlement and one adjoining road. The starting player begins by placing a settlement on an unoccupied intersection of their choice and then places a road adjacent to this settlement. The other players follow clockwise, each placing one settlement and one road. After all players have built their first settlement, the player who went last in the first round begins round two by building their second settlement and its adjacent road.

  },
  {
    "question": "How do resource probabilities affect placement strategy?",
    "expected": "Hexes with numbers like 6 or 8 have higher production probability (5/36 each), so placing adjacent settlements increases the chance to collect resources.",
    "predicted": "Resource probabilities can greatly influence placement strategy in the game. Players may want to prioritize settling near hexes with numbers that have higher probabilities of being rolled, such as 6 and 8, as they are more likely to yield resources. Additionally, players may consider diversifying their settlements to be adjacent to a variety of resource-producing hexes to ensure a steady income of different types of resources. Understanding the resource probabilities can help players make strategic decisions about where to place their settlements and cities to maximize their resource production throughout the game."

You can immediately place two new roads on the board, following the normal building rules. These roads must connect to your existing roads, settlements, or cities.\n3. You cannot build new settlements without also building roads.\n4. Remember that you can only build one road on each path, and you can build roads along the coast.\n5. If your turned road needs repairs, you must pay 1 lumber and 1 brick to repair it before building new roads.\n6. Roads turned sideways still count towards the \"Longest Road\" if you hold that special card.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow you to effectively resolve a Road Building card in the game."

  {
    "question": "How are ties broken for Largest Army or Longest Road?",
    "expected": "Ties favor the player who gained the card first; the other player must exceed that length or count to claim it.",

If two or more players tie for the Largest Army or Longest Road, the player who reached the milestone first gets the special card. If there is a tie for the new longest road, the \"Longest Road\" card is set aside until one player has the longest road of at least 5 road pieces."

  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if multiple players tie at 10 points simultaneously?",
